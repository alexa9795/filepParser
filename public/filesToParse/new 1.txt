there is not any simple solution for that. you need do some natural language processing (NLP) in your application and recognize each sentence. there is something call OpenNLP, it's a JAVA-based NLP parser tool. Or Stanford NLP parser in Ruby. you can find something like that for php.

here I found a set of classes for natural language processing in PHP https://exec.com/.
